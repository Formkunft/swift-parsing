# ``CollectionParsing``

A simple parser that can be used to parse arbitrary collections.

## Overview

The parser takes a collection as its subject and operates on the elements and subsequences of this subject.
There are general methods for processing any type of element, but there are also specialized methods for working with strings and regular expressions.
